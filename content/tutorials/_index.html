<p>We can first introduce statistics methods intuitively, then use R to realize it. At last, we can design an interactive code section.</p>
<p>Interactive code sections look like this. Make changes in the text box and click on the green “Run Code” button to see the results. Sometimes there will be a button with a hint or solution.</p>
<div class="puzzle">
<p><strong>Your turn</strong>: Modify the code here to show the relationship between health and wealth for 2002 instead of 2007.</p>
</div>
<p>{{% learnr url="https://andrewheiss.shinyapps.io/datavizm20_00-lesson-example/" id="learnr-00-lesson-example1" %}}</p>
<p>If you’re curious how this works, each interactive code section is a miniature <a href="https://shiny.rstudio.com/">Shiny</a> app hosted at <a href="https://www.shinyapps.io/">shinyapps.io</a>. Each app uses <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/"><strong>learnr</strong></a> to provide interactivity, and these <strong>learnr</strong> apps are embedded in this website with some <a href="https://desiree.rbind.io/post/2020/learnr-iframes/">HTML and Javascript wizardry</a>.</p>
